# Crypo Pricing Discord Bot

CPDB is a small project to learn about Node.JS. Is a Discord bot (using discord.js) which has 5 commands, depending the command is the response of the bot. 

In the future I plan to upgrade the bot adding new features.

This is the [URL](https://crypto-pricing-discord-bot.herokuapp.com/) for the server in Heroku.

When the server is running, you can add the CPDB to your Discrod Server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=963895540851015731&permissions=18432&scope=bot)

When the bot is on line, you can use the !help command to see the list of commands.

!ping - To check if the bot is working

!price <token_name> - To get the price of a token with respect to $USD

!token - To get the list of the token availables. To add token please send DM to @metaCrypt0

!help - For checking out what commands are available

!donate - Display my address if you want to support the project (buymeacoffe link in near future)
